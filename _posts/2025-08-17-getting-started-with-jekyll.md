# Getting Started with Jekyll and GitHub Pages

Jekyll is a fantastic static site generator that powers GitHub Pages. In this post, I'll share some insights about setting up a Jekyll blog.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll offers several advantages for bloggers and developers:

- **Simple**: Write in Markdown, deploy with Git
- **Fast**: Static sites load quickly
- **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages provides free hosting
- **Customizable**: Full control over your site's appearance and functionality

## Basic Jekyll Structure

A typical Jekyll site has this structure:

```
my-blog/
├── _config.yml      # Site configuration
├── _layouts/        # HTML templates
├── _posts/          # Blog posts
├── _includes/       # Reusable snippets
├── assets/          # CSS, images, etc.
└── index.html       # Homepage
```

## Writing Posts

Posts are written in Markdown and stored in the `_posts` directory. Each post needs:

1. **Front matter**: YAML metadata at the top
2. **Filename format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
3. **Content**: Written in Markdown

## Next Steps

In future posts, I'll cover:

- Customizing Jekyll themes
- Adding comments and analytics
- SEO optimization
- Advanced Jekyll features
