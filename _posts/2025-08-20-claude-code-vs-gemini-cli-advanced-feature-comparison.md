Both Claude Code (Anthropic) and Gemini CLI (Google) are cutting-edge AI coding assistants that live in the terminal, but they differ in design philosophy and specific capabilities. Below we break down key advanced features and how they compare, including the latest updates as of August 2025. A summary table follows for quick reference.

## Advanced Coding Automation & Refactoring

**Claude Code:** Built for power-users, Claude Code can generate code, write tests, refactor, and even handle multi-file edits autonomously. It excels at turning natural language requests into implemented features. For example, you can describe a feature or bugfix in plain English, and Claude will make a plan, write the code across files, run tests, and ensure it works. It handles tasks like resolving lint errors, merge conflicts, converting legacy code, and writing release notes in one go. Claude Code's workflow often involves breaking down complex problems into a to-do list or plan, which the user can review or refine before execution. It can also improve code quality iteratively: Anthropic notes that Claude's output "tends to improve significantly with iteration," so prompting it to refine its own solution can yield better results. Crucially, Claude Code can write and run tests on your behalf - for instance, finding untested functions, generating test scaffolding, then executing tests and fixing any failures. It also performs intelligent refactoring; you can ask Claude to find deprecated API usage and update an old utility file to modern conventions, then verify by running tests. These inline code transformations are applied directly to your files (with safeguards, see "Security” below).

**Gemini CLI:** Gemini CLI similarly automates coding tasks, with an emphasis on agent-driven, multi-step execution. It uses a ReAct reasoning loop under the hood, enabling it to plan and execute complex changes. Gemini CLI's new Agent Mode (rolled out mid-2025) acts as an AI pair programmer: given a high-level prompt, it will analyze your entire repository and propose a multi-file implementation plan. For example, you can prompt: "Add a new full-stack user settings page," and Gemini's agent will draft the changes across backend, frontend, and config files in one session. It handles large refactors ("Update all API endpoints to use new authentication”) or dependency upgrades and coordinates edits across many files automatically. Before applying changes, Gemini always presents a detailed plan and diff summary for approval, ensuring you oversee the automation. Once approved, it applies the code edits and can even auto-run tests or build steps if instructed. Like Claude, Gemini CLI can also generate tests to improve coverage (one of its touted use cases is "improving test coverage") for example, writing missing tests and updating CI configurations in response to a single command. Both tools therefore offer high-level "tell it what to do” automation for coding, but Gemini's agent mode has a more guided approval workflow, whereas Claude often works more free-form and interactively (unless the user explicitly asks for a plan first).

### Real Usage Example

In practice, a developer might ask Claude Code, “Implement the feature described in Jira ENG-4521 and create a PR". Claude will fetch the issue details via integration, plan out the code changes, edit files, possibly run npm test, and then commit and open a pull request - largely autonomously. With Gemini CLI, the developer could run the CLI in agent mode in VS Code, paste the same request, and Gemini would analyze the repository architecture (e.g. find relevant modules, data models), then present a step-by-step plan (with file changes). After developer approval, it would apply changes and could leverage its large context to ensure consistency across the codebase. Both approaches dramatically accelerate routine coding tasks, but Claude may feel more "hands-on keyboard" in the terminal, whereas Gemini (especially in IDE) feels like a collaborative AI partner presenting changes for review.

## Agentic Behavior: Planning, Autonomy, Memory

**Claude Code:** Claude is explicitly described as an "agentic coding" tool. It autonomously performs multi-step reasoning and uses tools (shell commands, etc.) to accomplish goals. One standout feature is "extended thinking" mode - by prompting Claude with keywords like "think deeply" or "think harder," you trigger it to engage in lengthy chain-of-thought reasoning (which is visible to the user in the interface). This is useful for complex architectural decisions or tricky bugs: Claude will output its step-by-step rationale or analysis, effectively letting you peek into its thought process. Anthropic notes that “extended thinking" uses the model's new ability to reason and even intermix tool use, thanks to Claude 4's upgrades. Claude 4 models can alternate between reasoning and tools, even running tools in parallel, to solve problems. This yields strong autonomous problem-solving - e.g. mapping out a debugging strategy, executing code to gather data, then adjusting its approach all in one continuous flow. Claude Code also supports Subagents (multi-agents): you can create specialized sub-agents for tasks like code review, testing, or security auditing. Claude can automatically delegate subtasks to these subagents when appropriate. For example, if you say "review my recent code changes for security issues," Claude might spin up a security-review subagent to analyze the diff. Users can define custom subagents (with custom instructions, tools, or even different model settings) in the claude/agents/ directory. This extensible agentic behavior is a powerful, advanced capability unique to Claude Code, enabling a form of recursive problem solving or task specialization.

By design, Claude Code is somewhat "low-level" and gives developers full control over autonomy. You can run it in normal mode (approval for each tool action) or in a "Safe YOLO mode" for full autonomy. "YOLO" mode (activated with --dangerously-skip-permissions ) lets Claude execute a plan start-to-finish without interruptions - useful for repetitive tasks like applying trivial lint fixes across dozens of files. Anthropic strongly cautions to sandbox or isolate your environment when doing this (e.g. in a Docker container without internet) since an unrestricted agent can potentially run risky commands. In summary, Claude's agentic style is highly flexible: you can treat it as an iterative collaborator (asking for plans, interrupting or editing its steps) or allow fully autonomous runs. Claude also has persistent memory files: when given file system access, Claude 4 will create “memory files" to store key facts and maintain continuity over long sessions. For instance, in a long-running session (even spanning hours), Claude might write down important details or decisions to a local file so it can recall them later, effectively improving its working memory for complex tasks.

**Gemini CLI:** Gemini's agentic behavior centers on its ReAct loop and new agent mode. The CLI continuously does reasoning → tool use → observation → reasoning... until it completes the task. This means it can handle multi-step operations like: “find the bug, open the file, fix the bug, run tests, confirm they pass." Indeed, Gemini CLI advertises dynamic troubleshooting where it will iteratively run and fix code until the problem is solved. However, in contrast to Claude's free-form chain-of-thought, Gemini's agent is a bit more structured and user-facing. In VS Code's agent mode, Gemini analyzes the entire codebase (not just open files) to build a mental model of your app (architecture, dependencies, patterns). This project-wide awareness lets it plan changes globally and with consistency (fewer “mismatched suggestions"). Gemini's agent then enables multi-file editing in one prompt - previously, one might manually generate code file-by-file, but agent mode orchestrates all needed edits automatically. Importantly, Gemini's agent always seeks user approval: it will output a detailed plan listing files to change and a summary of changes before doing anything irreversible. The developer can ask for clarifications or modifications to the plan, and only when satisfied, approve it. This design keeps the human “in the loop,” combining AI speed with your judgment. After execution, if the result isn't right, Gemini introduced automatic checkpointing and rollback (see below), so you can revert the entire codebase to the pre-change state with a single command.

Gemini CLI does not (yet) have an explicit "subagent" framework like Claude, but it does support extensions and custom tools (which could be used to achieve similar specialized behaviors see Extensibility section). Memory-wise, Gemini leverages Google's massive model context (Gemini 2.5 Pro has a 1 million token window). Practically, this means the Gemini agent can ingest your entire project (even very large codebases) into context if needed, or incorporate lengthy design docs, logs, etc., without losing information. In late 2025, community feedback praised Gemini's “relaxed” or large context for making broad codebase analysis easier. The trade-off is that Gemini's chain-of-thought is less visible by default – it tends to present distilled insights (like plans or summarized reasoning) to the user rather than raw reasoning steps. There is no official "extended thinking" command equivalent to Claude's, though Gemini's /compress command can summarize the conversation to save tokens (and presumably it does some automatic summarization if the context is exceeded, similar to Claude). Overall, Gemini CLI aims for autonomy with guardrails it will do quite complex, even recursive tasks (e.g. fix test failures by re-running tests and adjusting code), but always tries to keep the user in control of major decisions and changes.
